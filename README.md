- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @razarustami.
<p style="text-align:justify;">
  The world of aviation has always fascinated me, but lately, my curiosity has taken flight in a whole new direction. 
  The world of coding, data science, and artificial intelligence has become an exciting new frontier for me to explore. 
  While I may navigate the skies professionally, I'm also diving headfirst into the ever-changing world of technology.  
  This journey into programming is a testament to my lifelong love of learning. It's not just the physical skies that I crave to explore, 
  but the boundless possibilities of the digital age as well.
